# Ice Cream
Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream and is flavored with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice, such as cocoa or vanilla. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream)

## Ingredients
* 500g cherries, stones removed, quartered 
* 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 
* 200g sugar, divided 
* 250ml milk 
* 500ml cream 
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 

## Instructions
* Mix cherries, lemon juice, 100g of the sugar and vinegar in a small bowl and leave to infuse for 2 hours.
* Drain cherries, retaining the juice. Mash half of the cherries either with a fork or a food mixer, the other half can be left quartered.
* In another bowl, mix the milk and sugar with an electric mixer until the sugar has dissolved (about 1-2 minutes). Then stir in the cream, the cherry juice, the mashed cherries and vanilla.
* Put the mixture into ice cream maker and leave for 20-25 minutes to blend until the mixture has thickened. About 5 minutes before the end of the mixing time, add the quartered cherries and continue mixing. The ice cream will then be wonderfully creamy. Once the ice cream is solid, put it into a firmly closing a container and leave it in the freezer for two hours. Remove it from the freezer about 10 minutes before serving.
